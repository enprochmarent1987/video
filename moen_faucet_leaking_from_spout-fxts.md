## Why Moen Faucets Leak from the Spout  

Moen faucets are known for their durability, but even the best fixtures can develop leaks over time. The most common causes include:  
- **Worn-out Cartridge**: The internal cartridge controls water flow and can wear out after years of use.  
- **O-Ring Damage**: The O-ring, a small rubber seal, can degrade and cause leaks.  
- **Mineral Buildup**: Hard water deposits can clog or damage internal components.  
- **Loose Parts**: Over time, screws or connections may loosen, leading to leaks.

Repairing a leaking faucet isnâ€™t just about stopping the drip; itâ€™s about saving money and improving your homeâ€™s functionality. Hereâ€™s why itâ€™s worth addressing:  
- **Water Savings**: A single leaky faucet can waste hundreds of gallons of water annually.  
- **Reduced Bills**: Fixing the leak lowers your water and energy bills.
