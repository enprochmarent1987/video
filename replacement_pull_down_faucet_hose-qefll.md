## Steps Involved in Replacing a Pull Down Faucet Hose

1. **Turn Off the Water Supply**: Locate the shut-off valves under the sink and turn them off to prevent water flow during the replacement.

3. **Remove the Faucet Handle**: If necessary, unscrew the handle to access the hose connection point.
4. **Install the New Hose**: Attach the new hose to the faucet and tighten the connections securely. Ensure there are no twists or kinks in the hose.
