## Why Replace a Kohler Faucet Aerator?

The aerator is a small but crucial component of your faucet. It mixes air with water to create a smooth, consistent stream while conserving water. Over time, mineral deposits and debris can clog the aerator, leading to reduced water pressure or uneven flow. Here‚Äôs why replacing it is beneficial:

- **Improved Water Flow**: A new aerator ensures consistent and even water flow.  
- **Water Conservation**: Modern aerators are designed to use less water without compromising performance.  
- **Reduced Splashing**: A well-functioning aerator minimizes splashing, keeping your sink area clean.  
- **Cost-Effective**: Replacing an aerator is far cheaper than replacing the entire faucet.
