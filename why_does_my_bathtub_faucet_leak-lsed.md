## Common Causes of a Leaking Bathtub Faucet

Understanding why your bathtub faucet is leaking is the first step toward resolving the issue. Here are the most common causes:

- **Worn-out washers:** Over time, the rubber washers inside the faucet can degrade, causing leaks.
- **Loose or damaged O-rings:** These small rings seal the faucet handles and can wear out or become loose.
- **Corroded valve seat:** The valve seat connects the faucet and the spout, and corrosion can lead to leaks.
- **Faulty cartridge or stem:** In cartridge or compression faucets, a damaged or worn-out cartridge or stem can cause dripping.
- **High water pressure:** Excessive water pressure can strain the faucetâ€™s components, leading to leaks.

## Benefits of Fixing a Leaky Bathtub Faucet

Repairing a leaking faucet offers several advantages:

- **Save money:** Fixing a leak prevents wasted water, which can significantly reduce your water bill.
- **Prevent water damage:** Leaks can cause moisture buildup, leading to mold, mildew, or structural damage.
- **Extend faucet lifespan:** Timely repairs can prevent further wear and tear, prolonging the life of your faucet.
